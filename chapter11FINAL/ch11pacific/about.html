      <h3>Our Story</h3>
      <p>
        Pacific Trails started as a small family-owned retreat with one dream — to help people rediscover balance through the beauty of the outdoors. 
        Decades later, our mission remains the same: to make nature accessible while maintaining the quiet charm that makes our resort feel like home.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you’re hiking through the redwoods, watching the sunrise over the cliffs, or simply resting by the fire, our team is here to make your visit an unforgettable experience.
