Limeade is what lemonade wishes it could be: the Beyoncé of beverages, bottled optimism, and the ultimate cheat code for summer vibes. One sip is basically a spa day for your mouth, a WiFi signal for your soul, and liquid confetti for your taste buds. Even limes dream of becoming limeade because it’s sunshine in liquid form—simple, legendary, and 100% pucker with 0% problems. Forget soda, water, and kale juice; limeade is the real MVP, the chill pill you can sip, and the drink that makes even Monday mornings less rude. Honestly, if joy were drinkable, it would taste exactly like limeade.
